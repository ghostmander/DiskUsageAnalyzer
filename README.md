# Disk Usage Analyser
The inspiration for this project came from the need to understand the disk usage of my computer. I wanted to know which files and directories were taking up the most space. I also wanted to know how much space was being used by each file type.

Although alternatives, such as [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/), exist, I wanted to create my own disk usage analyser. I wanted to create a tool with a nice user interface like [Disk Usage Analyzer](https://apps.gnome.org/Baobab/) that also works natively on windows.

This tool will also allow me to understand the disk usage of my computer in a way that is meaningful to me. I will be able to see which files and directories are taking up the most space. I will also be able to see how much space is being used by each file type.
